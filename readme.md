# About

This project is an algorithm adopted from a backpacking manual (see notes within JS file itself), which helps an individual to gather a hiking travel time estimate. This algorithm is used in the `mean_hiking` tool application that is deployed at `http://hiking.tools`. When a user creates a new hike, this algorithm is used to generate an approximate travel time.

Note: Actual travel times may vary depending upon each individual. This tool is merely to give you a ballpark window to better plan your travel. Individuals should note their actual travel times in comparison to the estimated travel time, and plan accordingly in future outings. A rendition allowing for customization of hiking travel variables may be a future project. I generated a wireframe as well in this project folder, which could be a stream-lined version of a hiking estimator.
